# Memory-to-Memory assembly programming manual

The ISA is designed for direct memory operands:

```asm
MOV16 [0x1200], [0x1202]
ADD16 [0x1200], 7
AND16 [0x1200], 0x7FFF
```

`A0..A3` are pointer/address registers only, deliberately not general data registers, so the architecture remains a true memory-to-memory endpoint. Unary operations are direct read-modify-write operations. VRAM is separate and uses `VLD*`/`VST*`.

## Procedure blocks and unused-code removal

Public/callable routines should be written as `.proc NAME` ... `.endproc` blocks. `.entry NAME` makes the program entry procedure a reachability root; `.keep NAME` keeps hardware callbacks or standalone library-fragment procedures explicitly. After `.include` and `.equ` expansion, the assembler removes `.proc` blocks that are not reachable from these roots or from symbolic references in live code. Ordinary labels inside a procedure remain local control-flow labels and do not define separate collectible procedures.

## Graphics library

`graphics.asm` exports the fast `gfx_set_color`, `gfx_set_palette`, `putpixel`, `clear`, `hline`, and `vline` primitives plus the higher-level `line`, `rect`, `fillrect`, `circle`, and `fillcircle` procedures. ABI: A0=color for color/clear; palette: A0 -> 4-byte table; putpixel: A0=x,A1=y; hline: A0=x0,A1=x1,A2=y; vline: A0=x,A1=y0,A2=y1. Unused procedures are removed by procedure-GC.

Shapes with five or more logical parameters use the same 16-bit graphics parameter block on every ISA: `GFX_X0=0x00C0`, `GFX_Y0=0x00C2`, `GFX_X1=0x00C4`, `GFX_Y1=0x00C6`, `GFX_W=0x00C8`, `GFX_H=0x00CA`, `GFX_R=0x00CC`, `GFX_COLOR=0x00CE`. `0x00B0..0x00BE` is internal virtual-register scratch on some targets; `0x00D0..0x00FA` is additional graphics scratch/current-colour storage. Therefore `graphics.asm` reserves the full `0x00B0..0x00FA` range. `line` reads `(x0,y0,x1,y1,color)`, `rect/fillrect` read `(x,y,w,h,color)`, and `circle/fillcircle` read `(cx,cy,r,color)`. Procedure-GC removes unused shape procedures and dependencies.
